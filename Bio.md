Hullo! Iâ€™m Joel, good to meet you! ðŸŒ¸

I was born in Australia and moved to Florida to meet (and marry) my now-wife, Serena.
Currently 24 and very much looking to expand my skills and knowledge as much as I can.
Looking for bigger and better things to apply myself to every day.

I enjoy helping out the newest folks in the room, and to that end I created PSKoans;
it saves me explaining the exact same things many times a day, and is a little more fun than listening to a lecture!

In my downtime I enjoy a few video games, practicing my (poor) piano skills, and singing.
Lots of singing.
If you hear someone singing in the halls, thereâ€™s a decent chance itâ€™s me.
